Functions in the FINUFFT library that must be modified to implement dynamic dispatch:
- finufft_execute
- finufft_adjoined

Do not worry too much about extended "multi"-compiler support for the moment, *maybe* nice to have if time permits it.

To practice, start with a toy project first. An idea is to implement ChaCha randomness into the "random" library by Marco. *There is a source currently that has ChaCha20 SIMD, we should probably convert that to generic xsimd and then add dispatch over it.*

For next meeting:
- Prepare a central place for everything, notes, meeting minutes, code, other docs, etc.
- Find out if meetings can be recorded (pretty sure local recording is possible with Zoom with little ado).
- Prepare a plan, discuss it.

Exact thesis defence date can be fixed later, just don't worry about i too much for now. As long as I make sure I bring up things like the Midterm Meeting in advance enough.

For next meeting, make sure to read and explain any documentation and other papers you have received (as well as perhaps some of your own) to show your understanding.

On that note, describe explcitly what you actually reviewed and researched and came to understand, this is probably the best way to help the supervisors understand what you're doing.

For ChaCha20, maybe first try to understand the scalar part and do it in a scalar way, only then move on to xsimd without dispatch, then xsimd wit dispatch.

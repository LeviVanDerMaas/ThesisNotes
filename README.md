An Obsidian Vault for notes concerning my thesis project, which is about implementing an architecture dispatch mechanism into [FINUFFT](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft). These notes will be used for a variety of things: general notes (e.g. things to keep in mind or other notable things for development), recorded meeting notes, my planning, and anything else that is *note*worthy.  Different directories contain notes on different topics. Of particular interest may be the *Planning* directory, as files in here kind of serve as an agenda and overview of tasks that need doing.

I do use plugins, but pulling down this repo and opening it as an Obsidian vault should be sufficient to view all notes as they are intended: the plugins do not have any external dependencies and Obsidian automatically "bundles" both config and plugins into your vault (in the .obsidian directory) and don't require any additional installation steps once there.

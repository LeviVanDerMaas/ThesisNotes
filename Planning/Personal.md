	- Make some sort of centralized collection for all thesis related files (onedrive with links to git repos?)

	- Do some work so we don't just end up forgetting stuff we learned, but also make sure to take time off.

- [ ] Begin getting to work on thesis paper at the latest ⏳ 2026-01-05 🛫 2026-01-13
	- But do make sure to already do some basic literature research in advance.

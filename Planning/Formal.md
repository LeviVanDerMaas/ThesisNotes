Planning for all key moments of thesis that have some sort of formal deadlines (or formally recommended) to them. More info can be found [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/ewi-studentenportal/onderwijs/afstuderen-msc) and on Brightspace.

- [ ] Midterm Meeting ⏳2026-03-10 📅 2026-03-17
	- Currently difficult to say what exactly to discuss here. General ideas though:
	- Present work/progress thus far in an organized presentation, and describe aims and expectations for the future. This should involve both the "practical" work on the thesis (i.e. coding) as well as on the thesis document. 
	- It should especially be discussed in light of the [thesis assessment rubrics](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/492869/viewContent/3749921/View)
	- Similarly, based on my preparations of this presentation, I should also be able to formulate whether I think the goals as formulated in the thesis proposal are still valid or not; of course I should then discuss this with the supervisors and hear their opinions on it. Should a change be necessary, I think it must be reuploaded to MaRe?

- [ ] Thesis Committee Form ⏳ 2026-01-17 📅 2026-03-17
	- Must be **submitted at least three months before** the planned defence date, MaRe. It is recommended this is done **shortly after the midterm meeting**.
	- *But you should probably start fixing for a member of an external group at least two month in advance.*
	- Must have at least 2 core members, may have 3. All from TUD research groups.
	- The Chair must be from a research group involved in the master, that is, [this](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/cese/msc-computer-embedded-systems-engineering/programme/related-research-groups) list.
	- At least one core member must be of a research group different than the Chair's.
	- Chair must be full or associate professor, other core members must be full, associate or assistant professor (external expert may sometimes also be permittted).
	- In general, proposed form must comply with [Article 30 of BoE](https://filelist.tudelft.nl/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/EWI/Studeren/Reglementen/RRoBE%20EEMCS%202025-2026_FINAL.pdf).
	- *Chair can probably be Georgi or Mahmood, but both are from CE group so if both are on the commitee then there must be a third member not from CE.*

- [ ] Green Light Review ⏳ 2026-06-02 📅 2026-06-09
	- **Considering deadlines for things after this point are pretty strict, make sure you have at least one week of margin to scoot up the deadline.**
	- **Thesis draft should be ready by now.**
	- **This is the meeting where we set a date on the final examination form and preferably submit it.** *That also means shortly after this should be the submission of the final exam form.*
	- Think I should prepare and organize the contents of this meeting much the same for the midterm; of course any aims and future expectations at this point should be minimal changes to the draft and code at most.
	- I instead should go over each section of thesis draft more in-depth, note any final questions or concerns I might have and make sure to note down any recommend changes or other criticism by the supervisors. Again, pay special attention to the rubrics.
	- Address any other matters that need addressing before we can actually move towards graduation.
